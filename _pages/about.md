I am currently an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, Iran. 
I earned my Ph.D., M.Sc., and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Engineering, all in Software discipline, from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. 

My main research interests include perfromance modeling and evaluation of distributed computing systems. I am also interested in the application of analytical models to improve the performance and dependability of resource allocation and task scheduling in cloud computing. To find more information about my research interests please see here. A list of my publication can also be found here.

Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).
